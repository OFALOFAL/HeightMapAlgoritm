# HeightMapAlgoritm
Algoritm that generates mountain using glfw.
Light might be a bit odd becouse i used my own calculations for normals which dont work that great.

# If u want to edit code
Add Libraries folder and add there glm, stb, glad, glfw-3.3.8. Make sure that they are named propearly

To start program:
	Go to cmake-build-debug and click on HeightMapAlgoritm.exe

For help how to operate go to "help" in program's menu
