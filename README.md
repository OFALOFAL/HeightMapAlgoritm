# HeightMapAlgoritm
Algoritm for generating mountain-like terrains using glfw.
Light might be a bit odd becouse i used my own calculations for normals which dont work that great.

To start program:
Go to cmake-build-debug and click on HeightMapAlgoritm.exe

For help how to operate go to "help" in program's menu

### If u want to edit code...
You'll need to include libraries: 
* [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)
* [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb)
* [glad](https://glad.dav1d.de/) (Language: C/C++; Specification: OpenGL; Version 3.3; Profile: Core)
* [glfw-3.4](https://www.glfw.org/download.html) (Source package)

Put them in `libraries` folder and make sure that they are named properly.
